<Info>
  A single model setup is not recommended for production deployments.
</Info>

The initial phase in deploying Glide involves setting up your configuration file in the project root. For the basic setup, it is essential to have at least one pool with a minimum of one model. 
```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: my-chat-router
      strategy: priority
      models:
        - id: primary
          openai:
            api_key: "XXXXXXXXX"
```

Currently the only supported deployment is via container.

#### Docker
