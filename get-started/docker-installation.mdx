description: How to install and run Glide via Docker yyyy
---

The easiest and quickest way to run Glide is via our [demo repository](https://github.com/EinStack/glide-demo.git) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Clone the demo repository"}>
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/EinStack/glide-demo.git
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Init Configs"}>
        The demo repository comes with a basic config (learn more about [configurations]()). Additionally, you need to init your secrets by running:

        ```bash
        make init # from the demo root
        ```

        This will create the `secrets` directory with one `.OPENAI_API_KEY` file that you need to put your key to.

        <Info>
            Windows user should create the `secrets` directory and the corresponding `secrets/.OPENAI_API_KEY` file manually.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Start Glide"}>
        After that, just use docker compose via this command to start your demo environment:

        ```bash
        make up
        ```

        <Info>
            Windows users should simply run `docker-compose up -d`
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Sample API Request to `/chat` endpoint"}>
        ```json
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Where was it played?"
            },
            "messageHistory": [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."}
            ]
        }
        ```

        See [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for more details.
