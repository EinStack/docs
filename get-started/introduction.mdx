## üê¶ What is Glide?

Glide is a lightweight blazing-fast cloud-native [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) LLM gateway, delivering high-performance LLMOps in one single binary.
Glide provides a simplified way to build application resilience, reduce latency, and manage API keys among many other features.

<Warning>
    Glide is currently under development and the docs are updated frequently.

## Why Glide?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="The True Gateway" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        Focus on **your business logic** and application while letting Glide handle common LLMOps problems (like fallbacks, cost control, routing, caching, etc.)
    </Card>
    <Card title="Blazing-Fast & Cloud-Native" icon="bolt">
        High performance and scalability are our priority, so we don't slow you down and scale out as you grow.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Resilient" icon="scale-balanced">
        Glide is designed around resiliency and failures,
        so your application can achieve **high availability** working with external models and **survive** the toughest real-world situations.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Configurable" icon="puzzle-piece">
        A Glide cluster can serve multiple applications with totally different needs.
    </Card>
    <Card title="No Vendor Lock-Ins" icon="plug">
        Switch your model providers seamlessly for your application without a need to modify them.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Open Source" icon="people-group">
        We welcome all kinds of feedback and contributions in Glide. Let's make it work in the best possible way for you!

## Features

- **Unified API**: Change your model providers without a need to modify your applications
- **High Performance**: Written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) with the best practices of software development in a cloud-native environments in mind
- Flexible **routing** across several models and various strategies like [the least latency](/essentials/routers#least-latency-router), [weighted round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#weighted-round-robin-router), [round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#round-robin-router), [priority-based routing](/essentials/routers#priority-router). All strategies include **low-latency fallback mechanisms** to ensure resiliency
- Support [Popular LLM providers](/essentials/providers)
- **Centralized** configuration and API key management
- **Production-ready Observability**: Always know what's going on with the heart of your system via logs, metrics, and traces. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is natively supported (coming soon).
- and [much more is coming](https://github.com/EinStack/glide/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md)
