## Introduction

Routers are a core concept in Glide. They are most easily thought of a pools of models that execute predefine logic on your API calls.
There are more details on each router below but first let's look at a simple example.

## Example: Deploy a Resilience Router

A Resilience Router provides failover logic should a target model not be available. Below are building a router called `my-chat-router`.
'my-chat-router' is defined as a `language` router which accesses the `/chat` endpoints for supported providers. Additionally, we've specified this router to 
have a `priority` strategy which implements failover logic.

This router will first try Openai (default model: `gpt-3.5-turbo`) once the router token budget has been drawn down (more info below) the router will failover to 
an Azure OpenAI deployment.

Simple as that! Below we will cover each router in detail.


```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: my-chat-router
      strategy: priority # round-robin, weighted-round-robin, least-latency, priority, etc.
      models:
        - id: primary
          openai:
            api_key: "XXXXXXXXX"
        - id: secondary
          azureopenai:
            api_key: "XXXXXX"
            model: "glide-GPT-35"
            base_url: "https://mydeployment.openai.azure.com/"
```
