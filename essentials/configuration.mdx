Below details how to configure gateway. For more information on router types see the router page.

## Basic Configuration

At its simplest the gateway can be configured with a single router and two models.

This example shows a failover router leveraging OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. For OpenAI, Cohere, and OctoML, only an API key needs to be provided.
All other parameters, including the model, are provided by default. For Azure OpenAI, a model and base_url must be specified.

- `language` - This is the language API endpoint which supporta `/chat` endpoints from model providers
- `id` - A unique id for your router
- `strategy` - The type of router can be round-robin, weighted-round-robin, least-latency, priority
- `models/id` - **TODO: what values can this be?**


```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: my-chat-router
      strategy: priority
      models:
        - id: openai
          openai:
            api_key: "XXXXXXXXX"
        - id: azureopenai
          azureopenai:
            api_key: "XXXXXX"
            model: "glide-GPT-35" # the Azure OpenAI deployment name
            base_url: "https://mydeployment.openai.azure.com/" # the name of your Azure OpenAI Resource
```
